## About Me
### Hi, I'm Fiona! 👋 
😄 I'm a software engineer with a finance background, driven by a passion for problem-solving and innovation.

✨ Transitioning from a career in finance, where I excelled in private equity valuation, managing projects under pressure and fostering a supportive atmosphere within my team. I discovered my passion for coding through creating automation tools to streamline working process and enhance efficiency. This led me to pursue software engineering, leveraging my skills to create tangible and impactful solutions.

💻 In software development, I bring a strong foundation in both front-end and backend developments. But beyond technical skills, I excel in multitasking, time management, and resourcefulness. I'm known for my positive spirit and quick learning ability, traits that have served me well in every endeavor.

🤝 I'm excited to continue my journey in software engineering, bringing a unique blend of finance expertise and technical skills to the table. Let's connect and create something amazing!
